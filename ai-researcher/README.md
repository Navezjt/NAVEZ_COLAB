The AI Researcher is an AI agent that utilizes Claude 3 and SERPAPI to perform comprehensive research on a given topic. It breaks down the research process into subtopics, generates individual reports for each subtopic, and then combines them into a final comprehensive report.

## *New 4/9/24: The Gemini 1.5 Pro | YouTube Researcher Version*
I've added a new version of ai-researcher that takes advantage of Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro model. This version listens to a set of YouTube videos about a specific topic and creates a report based on their contents. Try it out with the `Gemini_Youtube_Researcher.ipynb` notebook in the repo!

## Features

- Generates a detailed checklist of subtopics to research for a given topic
- Performs multiple rounds of searches and analysis for each subtopic
- Generates individual reports for each subtopic
- Incorporates feedback from a "boss" persona to identify missing information and improve the reports
- Combines the subtopic reports into a comprehensive final report

## Usage

1. [Open the notebook in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fn2Xisstp0d30_bAaLPA1y-0_svojLF3?usp=sharing) or in a local Jupyter notebook.

2. Replace the placeholders `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `SERP_API_KEY` in the script with your actual API keys.

3. Run all the cells, and enter your topic to get started!

4. After research + generation is complete, the report will be saved as `comprehensive_report.txt` in the same directory as the script. Use a Markdown viewer to view the final report.

## Customization

You can customize the behavior of the AI Research Assistant by modifying the following parameters in the script:

- `model`: The name of the Anthropic Claude AI model to use (default: "claude-3-haiku-20240307").
- `max_tokens`: The maximum number of tokens to generate in each AI response (default: 2000).
- `temperature`: The temperature value for controlling the randomness of the AI responses (default: 0.7).

## Limitations

- The quality and accuracy of the generated reports depend on the performance of the Anthropic Claude AI and the relevance of the search results from SERPAPI.
- The script may take a considerable amount of time to execute, especially for complex topics with multiple subtopics.

Lastly, if you want to try something even cooler than this, sign up for [HyperWrite Personal Assistant](https://app.hyperwriteai.com/personalassistant) (most of my time is spent on this). It's basically an AI with access to real-time information that a) is incredible at writing naturally, and b) can operate your web browser to complete tasks for you.
